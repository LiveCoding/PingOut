PingOut
=======

Mix between Ping and Breakout. Done during our first sessions of live coding.


CONTROLS :
Up Down move one palette
Right Left move the other one
L load the briques (you shouldn't need that here)


PingOut Edit:
Let you draw your bricks with the mouse to after load them in the game.
Press to start drawing, release to validate the shape.
You can erase the last validated shape with "d".
Save with "s". Load with "l". Save/Load file is "data.txt".
Copy this file to the main folder to use it in the game.
